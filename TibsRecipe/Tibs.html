        <h3>DIRECTIONS</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><span class="recipedirection">Preheat pan:</span> Preheat pan  to 10 minut.</li>
          
  <p>Melt niter kibbeh or butter in a heavy saucepan on medium heat, 
  then add onions, ginger, garlic, and berbere. Reduce heat to
   medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally,
  until onions are dark, ruddy, and golden, about 30 minutes.
   Onions should be at a low sizzle during cooking process. 
   Adjust heat accordingly. Transfer to food processor 
   and blend until not quite a pur√©e. Return to saucepan,
    season to taste with salt, and keep warm.

                <p>
                    Season beef on all sides generously with kosher salt. 
                    Heat oil in a 12-inch cast iron or stainless steel skillet
                     over high heat high until lightly smoking. Add beef
                      in a single layer, leaving plenty of open space in the pan
                       (brown in batches if you don't have a large enough skillet). 
                       Cook without moving until well-seared on one side,
                        about 3 minutes. Flip meat cubes with tongs 
                        and cook on second side until well seared. 
                        Continue to cook meat, stirring and flipping occasionally
                         until desired level of doneness is reached. For rare meat,
                          transfer to saucepan immediately. For medium, cook an 
                          additional one to two minutes before transferring 
                          to saucepan. For well done, cook up to five more 
                          minutes before transferring to saucepan.
